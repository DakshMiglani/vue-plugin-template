# vue-plugin-template

> âœ¨ DX experience & lighter plugins ðŸš€


## Usage

```bash
vue init posva/vue-plugin-template my-awesome-plugin
# Answer some questions
cd my-awesome-plugin
yarn
npm run dev
# ðŸŽ‰
```

## Features

### Smaller plugin size
Bundle with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)

### Single file components
Write your components using `.vue` files. Those will be compiled into render
functions when building your plugin to make them compatible everywhere.

### JSX
Add jsx to your `js` files and they will be compiled as well.

### ES6
Use the future features of Javascript.

### Pre commit lint and fix
Runs `eslint` and `stylefmt`/`stylelint` before each commit on modified files
only and try to fix them automatically to prevent failing CI builds ðŸ˜‰.

### Advanced testing
Get the best developer experience by testing the components at the same
time you **interact** with them.

### Next generation CSS
Use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) by default with [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io/)
to bring you future features of CSS.

### Development-only features
Add warnings to improve the DX of your plugin that are removed when bundling in
production mode:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && warningCondition) {
  warn('You should be doing things this way instead: ...')
}
```
Refer to [Dist files](#dist-files) for more information.

## FAQ

### Dist files

_Q_: **Why are there 3 different generated files for js in the `dist` folder?**

_A_: Each one serves its purpose: the non minified file (`lib.js`) replaces `process.env.NODE_ENV` by `"development"` to keep development only features like warning (pretty much like Vue warnings). The CommonJS file (`lib.common.js`) is meant to be used with bundlers like Webpack or Rollup and keeps the variable `process.env.NODE_ENV` so it can be replaced by bundlers. The minified version (`lib.min.js`) strips off development features by replacing `process.env.NODE_ENV` by `"production"`.
